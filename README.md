This project explores the factors that influence airline passenger satisfaction using a real-world dataset. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and predictive modeling using machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.


📌Objective

To analyze structured airline service review data and identify which factors most affect passenger satisfaction, and to develop predictive models that classify satisfaction based on service experience, flight logistics, and demographics.

📁 Project Structure
Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, label encoding, and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing satisfaction trends across service features and demographics

Statistical Testing – Correlation analysis and chi-square test for categorical dependencies

Modeling

Logistic Regression (baseline, interpretable)

Random Forest (nonlinear, high-accuracy)

Evaluation – Accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices

Conclusion – Key insights and strategic recommendations for airline service improvement

📊 Key Tools and Libraries

Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

SciPy (for statistical testing)
